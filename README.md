  This repository is a playground for exploring how visuals break down and come back together again.
  <br>
  The focus here is on learning and implementing dithering techniques, ASCII-based rendering algorithms, and WebGL-powered tools for modern UI design. Each experiment treats images, text, and pixels as raw material, pushing them through transformations that trade realism for character, texture, and intent.
  <br>
  Rather than being a polished library, this repo is meant to document the journey. It collects small prototypes, experiments, and utilities that help understand how low-level visual algorithms work and how they can be applied to interactive interfaces on the web.
  <br>
  Ultimately, the goal is intuition. By rebuilding these techniques from first principles and combining them with WebGL, this repository aims to bridge the gap between classic computer graphics ideas and contemporary UI design workflows.
